Steps to use:

Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en

Restart terminal if it's open.
Navigate to the project repo, and run npm install.
Afterwards, just run npm run start. (Make sure the phone and the computer are on the same network before you do this step.)

Now, on the android phone, open up the Expo Go App. 

You can use the QRCode to look for open projects and click on the window blinds project.
The app itself should be pretty clear to use just DM Me beforehand if you're unsure.

The date is in 24hour format - do 00:00 for midnight and 12:00 for noon.
Open Percentage is out of 100. 100% is fully open, 0% is fully closed.

Everytime you need to restart the program, go back to the original page in the app and disconnet.

If you forget, just unplug the Arduino/Bluetooth module and plug it back in. It should be flashing before you try to reconnect.
